			<TestClassName>test.leap.tests.TestLCCommunication</TestClassName>
			<WhatTest> Tests the basic operations of life-cycle management (agent creation/killing) and communication (message exchange) in a MIDP environment.</WhatTest>
			<HowWorkTest> 
				1) The tester agent (running in the fixed network) requests the AMS to create a ping agent (a simple agent that just replies to messages sending back each received message) on a MIDP container.
				2) The tester agent sends a first message to the ping agent and waits for the reply. This reply must have the same fields (except sender and receiver) of the message that was sent.
				3) The tester agent requests the AMS to kill the ping agent.
				4) The tester agent sends a second message to the ping agent and waits for a FAILURE notification from the AMS since the ping agent should no longer be there.
			</HowWorkTest>
			<WhenTestPass> The test passes if all the described checks are OK, no exception is thrown and everything is completed within 30 sec.</WhenTestPass>

		<Test name="Message order preservation" skip="false">
			<TestClassName>test.leap.tests.TestMessageOrder</TestClassName>
			<WhatTest> Tests whether a number of messages exchanged between agents both in the fixed network and in the wireless environment are posted correctly and in the same order they were sent.</WhatTest>
			<HowWorkTest>
				An agent (the "light agent") on a wireless container carries out "conversations" with N participants agents in the fixed network. 
				Conversation with each participant Pi consists of sending K messages to Pi and receiving K messages from Pi. 
				Both the light agent and the participants waits a fixed time T after sending each message.
			</HowWorkTest>
			<WhenTestPass> 
				The test passes if all conversations are carried out (including message order) successfully.
