			<WhatTest>Tests the JADE capability of recovering from a main container fault
			</WhatTest>
			<HowWorkTest>The test creates a fault tolerence topology by starting a backup main container. 
			Then a peripheral container is attached to the backup main. 
			After that the master main container is killed and successively restored (now it plays the role of the backup main). 
			Finally the new master main container (initial backup) is killed too.
			</HowWorkTest>
			<WhenTestPass> The test passes if all the above operations succeeds and the platform continues to work properly.
