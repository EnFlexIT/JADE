			<TestClassName>test.mainReplication.tests.TestMainFault</TestClassName>
			<WhatTest>Tests the JADE capability of recovering from a main container fault
			</WhatTest>
			<HowWorkTest>The test creates a fault tolerence topology with 2 main containers (one master and one backup) and 2 peripheral containers (one per main). 
			The peripheral container attached to the backup main is launched with the -smaddrs option. 
			Then the master main container is killed and successively restored (now it plays the role of the backup main). 
			Finally the new master main container (initial backup) is killed too.
			</HowWorkTest>
			<WhenTestPass> The test passes if all the above operations succeeds, the platform continues to work properly and tool agents are kept up-to-date.
