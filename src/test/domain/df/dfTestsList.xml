		<Test name="Registration from remote platform" skip="false">
			<TestClassName>test.domain.df.tests.TestRemoteRegistration</TestClassName>
			<WhatTest> Tests accessing the DF agent by an agent living on a remote platform.</WhatTest>
			<HowWorkTest> In the load phase a remote platform is started with an agent on it. Another container with the IIOP MTP is also started in the local platform to enable inter-platform communication.
				In the actual test the agent on the remote platform i) waits for a startup message from the tester ii) registers with the DF of the local platform iii) waits for a continuation message from the tester and iv) deregisters with the df.
				The tester agent searches the DF after the registration and the de-registration

			</WhatTest>
			<HowWorkTest> 
				<br><b>Load phase</b></br>
				Seven DF agents are created and some of them register themselves to other DFs such 
				that the resulting graph of DFs has the following arcs:
				<br>arc1 = (df5,df6) (read as df5  is registered on df6)</br>
				<br>arc2 = (df4,df5)</br>
				<br>arc3 = (df2,df4)</br>

				<br>arc5 = (df3,df1)</br>
				<br>arc6 = (df1,df2)</br>
				<br>arc7 = (df1,df)</br>
				<br>After the federation has been created some agents are registered:</br>
				<br>df6 = {a14}</br>
				<br>df5 = {a13}</br>
				<br>df4 = {a11,a12}</br>
				<br>df2 = {a2,a3,a4}</br>

				<br>df ={}</br>
				<br>where each agent offers different services (use DF gui to have more details).
				<br><b>Actual Test</b></br>
				The test performs different queries changing the value of the parametes like
				max-depth, max-results and serivce type.</br>
				<br>See the log of the test for more details on query search and
				its results.</br>

				<br><b>Load phase</b></br>
				Launches 3 agents that subscribe to the DF to receive notifications.
