			<WhatTest> Tests if the subscription service is supported by the persistent JADE DF, 
					   you can execute this test only when you use persistent Knowledge Base, like DB.<br>
					   By default the test uses <b>sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver</b> driver and expected
					   url parameter. If you wish change this configuration, you can use configuration 
					   button of the toolbar to set new arguments.</br>
