			<WhatTest>Tests suspending and resuming agents by requesting the AMS to perform the Modify (with proper state values) action of the FIPAManagementOntology.</WhatTest>
			<HowWorkTest> 
				In the load phase a peripheral container is created and a dummy replyer agent is started on it. 
				Then the following steps are performed: 
				1) Send a test message 1 to the target replyer agent (a reply should immediately be received).
				2) Request the AMS to suspend the target replyer agent.
				3) Send a test message 2 to the target replyer agent (no reply should be received since the agent is suspended).
				4) Request the AMS to resume the target replyer agent.
				5) Wait for the reply to test message 2 that should immediately be received since the agent was resumed.
