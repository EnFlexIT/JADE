			<TestClassName>test.domain.ams.tests.TestSuspendResumeAgent</TestClassName>
			<WhatTest>Tests suspending and resuming agents by requesting the AMS to perform the Modify (with proper state values) action of the FIPAManagementOntology.</WhatTest>
			<HowWorkTest> 
				In the load phase a peripheral container is created and a dummy replyer agent is started on it. 
				Then the following steps are performed: 
				1) Send a test message 1 to the target replyer agent (a reply should immediately be received).
				2) Request the AMS to suspend the target replyer agent.
				3) Send a test message 2 to the target replyer agent (no reply should be received since the agent is suspended).
				4) Request the AMS to resume the target replyer agent.
				5) Wait for the reply to test message 2 that should immediately be received since the agent was resumed.

		<Test name="Install / Uninstall MTP" skip="false">
			<TestClassName>test.domain.ams.tests.TestInstallMTP</TestClassName>
			<WhatTest>Tests installing and un-installing MTPs by requesting the AMS to perform the InstallMTP and UninstallMTP actions of the JADEManagementOntology.</WhatTest>
			<HowWorkTest> 
				The test creates a remote container C1 in the load phase and then
				<UL>
	   			<LI>requests the AMS to install an iiop MTP on C1;</LI>
	   			<LI>chechs that the new address has been added to the local AID;</LI>
	   			<LI>searches the AMS for himself and checks that the new address has been added to the AMSDescription;</LI>
			    <LI>gets the platform description and check that the new address has been added;</LI>
			    <LI>requests the AMS to un-install the MTP;</LI>
	   			<LI>chechs that the address has been removed from the local AID;</LI>
	   			<LI>searches the AMS for himself and checks that the address has been removed from the AMSDescription;</LI>
			    <LI>gets the platform description and check that the address has been removed;</LI>
			    </UL>			
		  </HowWorkTest>
			<WhenTestPass>The test passes if the address of the installed/uninstalled MTP is correctly added/removed to i) the agent AID, ii) the AMS-Description of the Agent and iii) the Platform description.

		<Test name="MTP management on container crash" skip="false">
			<TestClassName>test.domain.ams.tests.TestMTPCrash</TestClassName>
			<WhatTest>Test the correct management of MTP addresses when a container running an MTP i) is started and ii) crashes.
			</WhatTest>
			<HowWorkTest>All the steps of this test are identical to those of the 'Install / Uninstall MTP' test except steps 1 and 5.
			Here a container with an MTP on it is created/killed instead of requesting the AMS to install/uninstall an MTP on an existing container. 
	    </HowWorkTest>
			<WhenTestPass>The test passes if the address of the new/dead MTP is correctly added/removed to i) the agent AID, ii) the AMS-Description of the Agent and iii) the Platform description.

		<Test name="Notification failure to sender" skip="false">
			<TestClassName>test.domain.ams.tests.TestNotificationFailureToSender</TestClassName>
			<WhatTest>Test the "notification failure to sender" mechanism.
			</WhatTest>
			<HowWorkTest>In this test we send a message to a number of agents that do not exist. Some of them look like local agents while others look like living on remote platforms and have a fake address or no address at all.
	    </HowWorkTest>
			<WhenTestPass>The test passes if we receive from the AMS one FAILURE message for each addressed agent.
