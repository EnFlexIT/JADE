			<TestClassName>test.stress.deadlock.TestForDeadlock</TestClassName>
			<WhatTest>Tests a possible deadlock when processing objects passed through the in-process interface from within a behaviour.</WhatTest>
			<HowWorkTest>An agent is created with a behaviour that gets objects passed by an external source through the O2A communication mechanism. Each object just includes a monitor where the external source starts waiting immediately after posting the object. The behaviour processing objects just signal on that monitor. If there are no objects available the behaviour blocks.</HowWorkTest>

			<Argument key="iterations" value="100000000"> The number of iterations to be performed by the test before it can be considered successful</Argument>
