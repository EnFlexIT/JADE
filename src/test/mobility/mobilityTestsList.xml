		<Test name="Do Move" skip="false">
			<TestClassName>test.mobility.tests.TestDoMove</TestClassName>
			<WhatTest> Tests the mobility proactively initiated by an agent by means of a call to the doMove() method.</WhatTest>
			<HowWorkTest> 
				This test requests an example.mobile.MobileAgent to move to another container 
				and then checks it has actually moved by asking its current location. 
				This process is repeated 4 times (including moving to the local container).
			</HowWorkTest>
			<WhenTestPass> The test passes if the agent move correctly.</WhenTestPass>
		</Test>	
		
		<Test name="Protocol in transit" skip="false">
			<TestClassName>test.mobility.tests.TestProtocolInTransit</TestClassName>
			<WhatTest> Tests the execution of an interaction protocol while an agent is in transit.</WhatTest>
			<HowWorkTest> The mobile agent initiates a Contract-Net protocol with 3 responders.<br/> 
				Each responder replies with a PROPOSE and puts the name of the container he lives on in the content.<br/>
				On receiving a PROPOSE the mobile agents moves on the indicated container and accepts all proposals.<br/>
				When all proposals have been received the mobile agent informs the tester agent.<br/>
				The same happens for result notifications.
			</HowWorkTest>
			<WhenTestPass> The test passes if the tester agent correctly receives the two INFORMs (one for responses and one for notifications) from the mobile agent.</WhenTestPass>
		</Test>		
		
		<Test name="Mobility ontology" skip="false">
			<TestClassName>test.mobility.tests.TestMobilityOntology</TestClassName>
			<WhatTest> Tests the MoveAction and CloneAction of the MobilityOntology.</WhatTest>
			<HowWorkTest> A mobile agent is started on Container-3.<br/>
			The tester requests the AMS to MOVE the mobile agent on Container-1 and then waits for a confirmation message from the mobile agent (who sends this message in his afterMove() method).<br/>
			Then the tester requests the AMS to CLONE the mobile agent on Container-2 and then waits for a confirmation message from the clone (who sends this message in his afterClone() method).
			</HowWorkTest>
			<WhenTestPass> The test passes if the tester agent correctly receives the two CONFIRMs.</WhenTestPass>
		</Test>
		
		<Test name="Clone big agent" skip="false">
			<TestClassName>test.mobility.tests.CloneBigAgent</TestClassName>
			<WhatTest> Test agent cloning and the transfer of an agent whose status includes a big amount of data.
			</WhatTest>
			<HowWorkTest> A Vector of 100000 10-byte-long elements (total 1MByte) is created. Then the TesterAgent itself is cloned on a remote container. 
			</HowWorkTest>
			<WhenTestPass> The test passes if the tester agent is actually cloned and the Vector is correctly transferred.
