README file for Base64 codec add-in for JADE.
=============================================

The source code contained whithin this directory subtree is covered by
the GNU General Public License, as decided by the copyright owner
Kevin Kelley.

The GPL license itself has been included as a text file named COPYING
in this same directory.

Even though JADE uses this source code, in no way it is to be
considered a derivative work from it, since it has been developed
completely from scratch and is therefore covered by the CSELT license terms.

In order to grant JADE users the right to modify the source code as
stated by the GPL,this class is not included within JADE.jar archive,
but is left alone. This way, users can freely substitute their own
modified version of the class; of course JADE is not and cannot be
expected to work with any modified version of the class.

The resulting class must have a fully qualified name of
starlight.util.Base64 and must be made available via CLASSPATH to the
JADE system. Were this class not found, a runtime error message will
notify the users, but only when they should try to use it. Therefore,
if you don't use ACL support for serialized Java objects, you don't
need the separate class.
