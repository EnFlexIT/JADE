README file for JADE $Name$ - Example programs.

Some example programs are provided in JADE package, to show various
framework features and suggested programming idioms.  To run the
examples, you must set CLASSPATH environment variable to contain the
file jade.jar, jadeTools.jar and Base64.jar and the current directory ('.').
Then change to 'src' directory and refer to the various example agents
with a fully qualified package name; all example agent classes belong
to subpackages of 'examples' package: for example, class Agent1 in
'ex1' subdirectory of 'examples' directory must be started 
by the jade/src directory with:

        java jade.Boot -platform examples.ex1.Agent1


The following list describes all the example programs found in
'src/examples' subdirectories, detailing their features.

'ex1' subdirectory
==================

 - Agent1.class                 An agent with a cyclic behaviour, printing 
                                a message once in a second. This shows
                                how an agent behaviour can be defined
                                in a class implementing
                                jade.core.Behaviour interface.

 - Agent2.class                 An agent which executes a behaviour once 
                                and then stops. This example shows how a
                                behaviour can be defined extending
                                jade.core.SimpleBehaviour class. It
                                also shows how an agent without active
                                behaviours is blocked. Besides, the
                                executed behaviour shows Message
                                Templates usage.

 - Agent3.class                 An agent with a behaviour made of many steps,
                                with some steps that have sub-steps
                                themselves. This examples shows how
                                jade.core.SequentialBehaviour class
                                allows the construction of aggregate
                                behaviours starting from simpler ones,
                                even with recursive aggregations.
                                Besides, it shows the cooperative
                                multitasking presently used for
                                intra-agent behaviour scheduling.

 - Agent4.class                 This agent uses both SequentialBehaviour
                                and NonDeterministicBehaviour classes
                                to build more complex behaviours from
                                simpler ones.



'ex2' subdirectory
==================

 - AgentReceiver.class          This example creates an agent that continously
                                waits for messages and sends back automated 
                                replies; it shows how to create a simple
                                server agent, purely reactive.

 - AgentSender.class            This agent works together with AgentReceiver
                                to build a simple client/server
                                interaction. The agent asks the user
                                for a message and an agent name. It
                                then sends the string to the specified agent.
                                This example, together with the
                                previous one, shows how the
                                distributed Agent Platform allows
                                message passing between the agents.

 - AgentBroadcaster.class       This agent combines message passing with
                                ComplexBehaviour class to achieve
                                more complex interactions between agents.
                                This Agent asks for a string and three
                                agent names; then it sends the string
                                to each one of the three agents,
                                collecting the replies. Eventually, it
                                prints the concatenation of the three
                                replies.

 - FilebasedSenderAgent.class	This is a simple GUI-based agent. It
				can read an ACL message from a user
				specified file and send it to other
				agents; besides, outgoing and incoming
				messages are logged in two
				panels. This agent can be useful for
				debugging and testing.

'ex3' subdirectory
==================

 - AgentThread.class            An agent that starts a simple conversation
                                using 'reply-with' and 'reply-to'
                                message fields to follow a
                                conversation thread. This example
                                sheds some light on selective
                                receive() using MessageTemplate
                                objects.

 - AgentMessageFilter.class     This is the companion of the previous agent;
                                it receives an incoming message and uses
                                'reply-with' field to answer the
                                message in a specific conversation thread.



'ex4' subdirectory
==================

 - AgentRequester.class         This agent plays initiator role in a
                                conversation following standard
                                'fipa-request' protocol. The example
                                program shows how more complex
                                interactions (such as agent
                                interaction protocols) can be handled
                                with primitives provided by JADE
                                framework, such as composite
                                behaviours and advanced message
                                passing.

 - AgentResponder.class         The companion agent of AgentRequester.
                                This agent plays responder role in
                                'fipa-request' protocol and is able to
                                manage multiple simultaneous
                                conversations through
                                'conversation-id' message field.



'ex5' subdirectory
==================

 - amsTester.class              This agent allows a comprehensive testing
                                of the Agent ManagementSystem of
                                JADE. When the agent is started, it
                                asks the user for an action name and
                                some parameters, then builds a
                                'fipa-request' conversation with the
                                AMS using the data gathered from the
                                user.

 - dfTester.class               This agent is for Directory Facilitator
                                just the same thing amsTester is for
                                Agent Management System. It allows the
                                user to make requests to DF agent
                                interactively.

 - SubDF.class			This examples shows how to set up multiple
				Agent Domains by means of a network of
				connected Directory Facilitator Agents.
				This agent can register itself with another
				DF, exploiting recursive search capabilities.


'ex6' subdirectory
==================
This example shows the usage of the FIPAQuery protocol in jade.proto
AgQueryInit is the initiator of the protocol while AgQueryResp is the
responder.
You can execute the example with the following command: 
java jade.Boot -platform initiator:examples.ex6.AgQueryInit responder:examples.ex6.AgQueryResp
and then use the GUI of the initiator to send a query message to the responder.


'ex7' subdirectory
==================
This example shows how to transport serialized Java objects over an ACLMessage.
You can execute it, for instance, with the following command:
java jade.Boot -platform a1:examples.ex7.ObjectWriterAgent a2:examples.ex7.ObjectReaderAgent
- ObjectReaderAgent: the agent registers with the DF and than enters into a 
loop. In this loop, it waits for the next incoming message, and dumps all
the Java objects into the message.
- ObjectWriterAgent: the agent searches in the DF for an ObjectReaderAgent,
and than sends a message with some Java objects.


jess subdirectory
=================
JessAgent is a sample agent that allows the programmer to avoid writing any 
line of Java code. He can implement everything in CLIPS by using JESS.
The code IS just the file JadeAgent.clp.
Every time an ACL message arrives, a new fact is asserted in JESS.
A function allows to send messages.
In order to compile this example, JESS is needed. It has been already tested
with JESS 4.3

ex_mobile subdirectory
======================
This is a simple mobile agent.
Send the message 
(REQUEST :content (move Container-1))
and the agent moves to Container-1, send again
(REQUEST :content (move Front-End))
and it moves to Front-End.
