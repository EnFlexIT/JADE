This package contains <b><em>FIPA</em></b> specific agents and
ontologies. Standard <b><em>FIPA</em></b> system agents
implementations are held within this package:
<ul>
<li> <b>ACC</b> agent to forward messages to agents on demand and to
receive incoming <em>IIOP</em> messages and forward them to platform
agents.
<li> <b>AMS</b> agent to manage agent platform life cycle for platform
agents and to hold white pages informations about them.
<li> <b>DF</b> agent to keep yellow pages informations about agents,
allowing multi-domain applications throug <em>DF</em> federation.
</ul>
The standard <code>fipa-agent-management</code> ontology is
represented by a class contained in this package, too.
Lastly, platform administration is performed using a <em>GUI</em>
directed agent, called <b><em>RMA</em></b> (<em>Remote Monitoring
Agent</em>); this agent can talk with the <em>AMS</em> using an
extension of <code>fipa-agent-management</code> ontology.
