<HR>
<P>The GUI&nbsp; of the Directory Facilitator shows a tabbed pane with
three different views of the functions provided by a DF.
<BR>The three views are:
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Agents registered with the DF</B> shows a table with all the agents
registered with the DF.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Last Search Result</B> shows a table with the list of agent descriptions
that were returned as a result of the last search operation.</LI>

<LI>
<B>DF Federation</B> shows the DF federation. The Parents table shows the
list of DF's with which this DF is federated, while the Children table
shows the list of DF's that are registered with this DF.</LI>
</UL>
According to the tab selected, only some actions are allowed:
<OL><B>Agents registered with the df</B>.
<UL>
<LI>
<B>View</B> the description of the selected agent from the table.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Modify</B> the description of the selected agent.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Register</B> an agent with the DF. The user is then requested to fill
in an agent description, notice that some values are mandatory for registration,</LI>

<LI>
<B>Deregister</B> an agent selected in the table.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Search</B> for agent descriptions with this DF. If no value is inserted
in the agent description, the search action returns all the active agents
currently registered with this DF.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Search with constraints</B> allows to make a search with this DF by
adding further constraints, as specified by the FIPA specifications. The
constraints inserted are stored to avoid inserting them again for the next
operation. Two kinds of constraints are permitted <TT>df-depth</TT>: the
depth of propagation of the search operation to the federated DF's, and
the <TT>resp-req</TT>: the number of returned agent descriptions.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Federate</B> allow to federate this DF with another DF. First of all,
the user must provide the full name of the DF with which to federate and
then the description of this DF that must be registered with the specified
DF.</LI>
</UL>
<B>Last Search Result</B>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>View</B> the description of a selected agent on the table of the results.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Search</B> for agent descriptions with this DF. (see above)</LI>

<LI>
<B>Search with Constraints</B> (see above).</LI>
</UL>
<B>DF Federation</B>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>View</B> the description of an agent selected in one of the two tables.
If the agent selected is a parent, then the default description of this
DF is shown. Otherwise if the selected agent is a child, then the description
of this child DF is shown.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Deregister</B> If the selected agent is a parent then this DF is deregistered
from the selected one, otherwise, if the agent selected is a child, this
child is deregistered from this DF.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Search</B> permits to make a search with default constraint with the
DF selected in one of the tables (If the DF GUI is referred to an applet
the search returns agents registered with this DF ).</LI>

<LI>
<B>Search with constraints</B> permits to make a search with constraints
with the DF selected in one of the tables (If the DF GUI is referred to
an applet the search returns agents registered with this DF ).</LI>

<LI>
<B>Federate</B> allows to federate this DF with the selected one.</LI>
</UL>
</OL>
