DummyAgent is a simple yet very useful tool for inspecting message exchanges
among JADE agents.
<br>It is a JADE agent itself and, therefore, must be launched within a
JADE container.
<br>There are two ways to launch it:
<br>1. from the Tools menubar of the JADE GUI
<br>2. with the following command:
<br><i>java jade.Boot da:jade.tools.DummyAgent.DummyAgent</i>
<p>The agent allows to send ACL messages to agents, receive and inspect
messages from agents, read and save messages from/to file.
