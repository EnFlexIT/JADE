SocketProxyAgent is a JADE agent that can be executed to communicate with
remote clients via a socket.
<br>It is a JADE agent itself and, therefore, must be launched within a
JADE container with the following command:
<br><i>java jade.Boot spa:jade.tools.SocketProxyAgent.SocketProxyAgent</i><i></i>
<p>At the startup, the agent searchs for a file that contains its initialization
parameters.
<br>The file must be named &lt;agentname>.inf and must be put in the current
working directory.
<br>The first line in this file must contain the port number to which the
agent listens for connections (put 0 for the default port number, i.e.
6789).
<br>The second line in the file must contain the list of agent names P
that wishes to be forwarded messages by this proxy agent. Names must be
on a single line and must be separated by a blank.
<p>The agent accepts up to 50 parallel connections.
<br>Each message that arrives through the socket, is parsed, the destination
agent is checked against the list of agent names P, and, eventually, forwarded
to the destination agent. Each answers from the destination agent, is forwarded
through the socket again.
