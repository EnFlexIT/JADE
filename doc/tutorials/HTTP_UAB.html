<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
This new implementation of the HTTP MTP tries to cover the lacks of
the old implementation providing a robust, lightweight, efficient, and
easily-configurable HTTP MTP.</p>
<p>
The new implementation has several new features and fixes with respect
to the old one. In this introduction we will explain which are these
features and how can they help to agents' programmers.</p>

<h3>1.1 Simple Implementation</h3>
<p>
This new implementation is composed of only 7 classes in front of the
~60 of the previous one.</p>

<h3>1.2 Catching Errors</h3>
<p>
When the MTP produces an error during its execution, it should
generate an MTPException. From the agents point of view this exception
is translated into a FAILURE ACL message sent back to the agent.
</p><p>
The old implementation did not throw all the errors. An example was
when an agent sent messages to a platform that was not on-line. The
HTTP MTP produced an SocketException which was not transmitted to the
platform. The result was that agents didn't have a mechanism to decide
if the message was received or not.
</p><p>
In the new implementation all failure cases are transmitted. This
opens the possibility of building more robust and fault-tolerant
applications using this new MTP.
</p>

<h3>1.3 Performance Improving: Persistent connections</h3>
<p>
One of the drawbacks of using HTTP MTP instead of the IIOP MTP (not
only in JADE, also in other platforms) was the low performance of the
first one. One of the main reasons of this difference is caused
because IIOP uses persistent connections. HTTP MTP usually starts a
TCP connection for each message coming from one platform to
another. Instead of doing the TCP handshaking protocol for every
message, connections could be reused with the platforms which we
communicate so often. This new feature improves very much the
performance of this MTP.
</p><p>
This new version of the HTTP MTP can keep some connections to other
platforms alive. The use of this mechanism improves a lot the timmings
of inter-platform message sending, and it is totally compatible with
FIPA-compliant platforms that do not implement it.
</p><p>
We can choose to use keep-alive or close connections from the
configuration.  If we choose to use keep-alive connections but the
platform, which we want to communicate with does not support it, the
behaviour of the HTTP MTP will be like if using a close connection
with this platform.
</p>

<h3>1.4 Using HTTP MTP in restricted environments: HTTP Proxies</h3>
<p>
Also two experimental features has been included in this
version. Those are the possibility of using HTTP Proxies and choose
the outgoing port.
</p><p>
As we use an HTTP protocol we can exploit the possibilities of this
protocol to cross restricted networks. The first of this features is
the possibility of using an HTTP Proxy instead of sending the messages
directly to the remote platform. This feature will not affect the FIPA
compatibility of this protocol, and if the proxy is properly
configured, the keep-alive mechanism can also work.
</p><p>
The second feature is the possibility of choosing the local outgoing
port for platform connections.
</p><p>
This two issues can be useful in some corporative environments where
network access is usually restricted.
</p>

<h3>1.5 Easy Configuration</h3>
<p>
This version of the HTTP MTP only works with the versions of JADE >=
3. In this versions a mechanism is included in order to use the
typical configuration files of JADE to include parameters for the
MTP. The effect is that the parameters of the MTP are not hardcoded to
the distribution and we do not need to recompile the MTP every time we
want to change them.
</p>

<h3>1.6 HTTPS Support (new)</h3>
<p>
Recently, support for HTTPS connections has been added to HTTPS this
support permits to establish secure and authenticated connections
between platforms.
</p>

<h2>2. Building and Installing</h2>

<h3>2.1 Building</h3>
<p>
The distribution must be unziped within the jade folder. It will add an 
http-mtp to your add-ons directory. Inside it, exists a "build.xml" Ant file, so using Jakarta Ant
we only need to run ant with no target to compile the sources and run
"ant lib" to create the "http.jar" file that will be located in dist folder.
</p><p>
If JDK 1.3 is used with target "ant pjava", this creates a pjava version of this MTP (http-pjava.jar).
Note that this version requires a SAX parser (see section 3) 
and requires the LEAP add-on to be present and "JadeLeap.jar" for pjava created.
</p>

<h3>2.2 Installing</h3>
<p>
To use the HTTP MTP we can choose to specify it from the command line:
</p>

<tt>java jade.Boot -mtp jade.mtp.http.MessageTransportProtocol</tt>
<p>
or install it from the RMA's graphical environment. Obviously, the http.jar
containing the MTP class files must be in the classpath.
</p>

<h2>3. Basic Configuration</h2>
<p>
As we said in previous sections, the new version of JADE allows to
pass configuration parameters to the MTP via the JADE Configuration
file. So, when we execute jade with a configuration file:
</p>

<tt>e.g. java jade.Boot -conf jade.conf</tt><br><br>

or directly from the command line:
<br><br>
<tt>e.g. java jade.Boot -jade_http_mtp_numKeepAlive 5</tt><br>
<p>
We can include some parameters that are exclusive of this MTP and that
can help its tuning. If we do not specify this parameters in
the configuration file, default values are taken.
</p>

<tt>jade_http_mtp_numKeepAlive=n</tt>
<p>
This parameter allows you to limit the maximum number of
persistent connections that the mtp is allowed to keep. Default value
for this parameter is 10. 0 means keep alive connections are not used.
</p>

<tt>jade_http_mtp_outPort=n</tt>

<p>We can set the local port open by sockets setting up this
parameter. If this parameter is not specified, a random port will be
used.</p>
<tt>
jade_http_mtp_proxyHost=hostName<br>
jade_http_mtp_proxyPort=portNumber
</tt>
<p>
Setting up these parameters we can use a HTTP Proxy to redirect
the platform outgoing messages. If these parameters are not specified, then
connections will be opened directly to the remote platforms.
</p>

<tt>jade_http_mtp_parser=saxClassName</tt>
<p>    
The HTTP MTP needs a SAX XML Parser. We can choose the SAX
implementation of the parser by indicating a classname (which must be in the classpath).
Since by default this MTP uses J2SE v1.4 default parser, this option is mandatory with JDK 1.3 or earlier.
<p>

<tt>jade_http_mtp_timeout=milliseconds</tt>
<p>   
The Server part of the HTTP MTP keeps also connections from
other platforms that are using the keep-alive feature. By setting up
this timeout we can set a maximum idle time for this connections in
order to improve the memory consumption. Default value for this
parameter is 60000 (1 minute). If we want this time to be infinite we
must put this value to 0.
</p>

<h2>4. HTTPS Support</h2>
<p>
This last release of HTTP MTP includes support for HTTPS, what means
HTTP over SSL connections. This functionality basically permits having
a secure and authenticated channel between platforms using this MTP.
</p><p> 

How it works ? Basically when a connection is being established
between two platforms, the platform acting as server (receiver), sends
its Certificate to the platform that acts as client (sender). At this
moment, the client side must decide if this certificate is
trusted. Optionally, the server can request the client to be
authenticated. If this occurs, client must send its certificate to the
server and makes also its own trust decision from the received
certificate. At this point, if both parts agree in having a secure
communication (because they trust each other), they exchange a session
key, that will be used to encrypt all data sent through the network.
</p>
<p> What we gain in using HTTPS? We gain in security. Using SSL in
communications we are sure that nobody can spy data sent through the
network. If we are doing trust decisions properly, we are also sure
that messages are sent to the correct platform. If we force client
authentication, we can also assure that platforms sending messages to
our platform are trusted platforms.
<p>
What we loose ? Obviously we loose in performance. HTTPS MTP is
approximately 15% slower than normal HTTP MTP.
</p>

<h2>5. HTTPS Configuration</h2>

<p>HTTPS MTP configuration is not easy as with HTTP MTP. It requires
to understand some basic concepts that will be exposed in the
following lines.</p>

<p>As we said in the previous section using SSL connections implies
using certificates to authenticate platforms. It implies also making
decisions when a certificate from a remote platform is received. All
those things are done automatically by this MTP but we must specify
where this certificates are, and which trust decisions are made when
remote certificates are received.</p>

<h3>5.1 Java keytool</h3>

<p>The first step in order to use HTTPS MTP is creating our platform's
certificate. We can solve this step by using java keytool. This
program is provided with Java SDK and JRE platforms. If we don't have
a certificate signed by a Certification Authority, we can create our
own self-signed certificate by using the following command:</p> <br>
<b>keytool -genkey -alias name -keystore filename</b>
<br>
$ keytool -genkey -alias myplatformname -keystore keyfile<br>
Enter keystore password:  mypassword<br>
What is your first and last name?<br>
  [Unknown]:  Joan Ametller<br>
What is the name of your organizational unit?<br>
  [Unknown]:  CCD <br>
What is the name of your organization?<br>
  [Unknown]:  UAB<br>
What is the name of your City or Locality?<br>
  [Unknown]:  Bellaterra<br>
What is the name of your State or Province?<br>
  [Unknown]:  Barcelona<br>
What is the two-letter country code for this unit?<br>
  [Unknown]:  SP<br>
Is CN=Joan Ametller, OU=CCD, O=UAB, L=Bellaterra, ST=Barcelona, C=SP correct?<br>
  [no]:  yes<br>
<br>
Enter key password for <myplatformname><br>
        (RETURN if same as keystore password):<br>  
<br>
<p>After this step we have a java Keystore (file named
<i>keyfile</i>) that contains our platform's certificate and private
key. This information is protected with the password
<i>mypassword</i>.</p>

<h3>5.2 Key Managers</h3>

<p>The sending of certificates during the handshaking process of the
protocol is done automatically. Key Managers are responsible to locate
the certificate and private key of the platform when are needed by
HTTPS. The default KeyManager searches for keys and certificates
inside a Java Keystore file. There are two mandatory arguments for
default keymanager: location of our platform's Java Keystore file and
password for accessing key material inside this file. The name of the
parameters can be specified from the command line: </p>

<br>
java jade.Boot -jade_mtp_http_https_keyStoreFile=keyfile
-jade_mtp_http_https_keyStorePass=mypassword <br>

<p> Or putting them inside a jade configuration file</p>

<h3>5.3 Trust Managers</h3>

<p>As we said in the introduction, an HTTPS client must perform some
trust decisions. More precisely, when a server certificate is received
it must be decided weather this certificate is trusted or not. In case the
certificate is not trusted, the connection will be aborted. This trust
decision is done automatically by HTTPS MTP and we provide 3 different
behaviours for performing trust decisions:</p> 

<ol> 

<li><b>No Authentication: </b>When the server's certificate is
received, we trust this certificate always without checking it. In other
words, we trust all certificates. This behaviour is dangerous from the
security point of view (we have no authentication) but it is the
easiest behaviour in terms of configuration.</li><br>

In order to use this kind of behaviour we must set the next
configuration parameter:<br>

<i>jade_mtp_http_https_tustManagerClass=jade.mtp.http.https.NoAuthentication</i><br><br>

<li><b>Strong Authentication: </b> When the server's certificate is
received, we will only trust this certificate if it is signed by one
of the official Certification Authorities recognised by Java
(VeriSign, Thawte, ...). The list of this Certification authority
certificates is inside the file JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts,
and can be listed using keytool program (keytool -list -keystore
cacerts)</li><br>

To use Strong authentication we must set the parameter
<i>trustManagerClass</i> as follows:<br>
<i>jade_mtp_http_https_tustManagerClass=jade.mtp.http.https.StrongAuthentication</i><br><br>

<li><b>Friend List Authentication: </b>This last behaviour uses as
parameter, a java keystore containing a list of trusted
certificates. When a secure connection is being established and
certificates are sent, only certificates that are present inside our
list of trusted certificates, or certificates issued by one of this
trusted certificates will be accepted. </li><br>

This last behaviour needs some more parameters than the others
listed. We will need to set 3: 

<ul>
<li><i>jade_mtp_http_httpstrustManagerClass=jade.mtp.http.https.FriendListAuthentication</i>
Indicating that Friend List based behaviour will be used by this
MTP</li> <li><i>jade_mtp_http_https_friendListFile=trust.ks</i>
Indicating the file containing the list of trusted certificates.</li>

<li><i>jade_mtp_http_https_friendListPass=mypassword</i> Indicating the password for the keystore containing the list of trusted certificates.</li>
</ul><br>

How can we create a list of trusted certificates ? Using keytool
program. We will explain that through an example. Imagine that Alice
has her own Java Keystore with its certificate and private key. Bob
wants to create a list of trusted certificates including Alice
certificate in it. The steps to create the list must be the next:<br>

<ol> 
<li> First of all, Alice needs to export its certificate from its
Java KeyStore file and give it to Bob. In order to export this certificate
Alice must execute the following command:</li><br>
<b>keytool -export -alias certName -file alice.cer -keystore
alicekeystore</b><br> 
This will export Alice certificate to the file alice.cer<br><br>
<li> Alice gives alice.cer to Bob</li>
<li> Bob includes certificate of alice in its list of trusted certificates by using the command:</li><br>
<b>keytool -import -alias alice -file alice.cer -keystore trustedList</b>
</ol>
</ol>

<h3>5.4 Client Authentication</h3>
<p>
As we said previously, we can force authentication from the server
side. This means that we are forcing all platforms trying to send
messages to our platform to be authenticated. This issue can help us
to restrict the set of platforms being able to send messages to us. To
enable this feature you only need to set the following parameter:</p><br>
<i>jade_mtp_http_https_needClientAuth=yes</i>

<h3>5.5 Switching on HTTPS</h3> 
<p>
HTTPS MTP is included within the HTTP MTP so it is not really another
MTP. The behaviour of this MTP is working without secure
communications by default. If we want the MTP running with secure
connections, we must initialise it by setting a transport address
beginning with "https". This will be detectedat the
beginning and security connections will be used. Of course, using
security connections implies setting also required configuration
parameters as we said previously.</p>
Example starting HTTP MTP with HTTPS support:
<br><br>
<b>java jade.Boot -mtp jade.mtp.http.MessageTransportProtocol(https://machine:port/acc)</b>

<h3>5.6 Configuration Examples</h3>

<p>For all the cases explained here we need platform certificate and
private key. We will suppose that we have created a self signed-certificate
for our platform:</p>
<b>keytool -genkey -alias myplatform -keystore mykeys.ks</b><br> 

<p>After this file is created we will show some jade configuration
files, exploiting all HTTPS MTP different behaviours:</p><br>

<b>1. No Authentication Configuration</b><br><br>
Configuration parameters inside jade.conf file:<br><br>
--------------------------<br>
mtp=jade.mtp.http.MessageTransportProtocol(https://myhost:7778/acc)<br>
jade_mtp_http_https_keyStoreFile=mykeys.ks<br>
jade_mtp_http_https_keyStorePass=mypassword<br>
jade_mtp_http_https_trustManagerClass=jade.mtp.http.https.NoAuthentication<br>
--------------------------<br><br>
<b>2. Strong Authentication Configuration</b><br><br>
Configuration parameters inside jade.conf file:<br><br>
--------------------------<br>
mtp=jade.mtp.http.MessageTransportProtocol(https://myhost:7778/acc)<br>
jade_mtp_http_https_keyStoreFile=mykeys.ks<br>
jade_mtp_http_https_keyStorePass=mypassword<br>
jade_mtp_http_https_trustManagerClass=jade.mtp.http.https.StrongAuthentication<br>
--------------------------<br><br>
<b>3. Friend List Authentication Configuration</b><br><br> Remember
that using a configuration based on a Friend List implies creating
a list of trusted certificates (see section 5.3). We will suppose that
we have created this list previously and it is named
<i>friends.ks</i>. The password used to protect this file is
<i>mypassword</i>.<br><br> 
Configuration parameters inside jade.conf
file:<br><br> 
--------------------------<br>
mtp=jade.mtp.http.MessageTransportProtocol(https://myhost:7778/acc)<br>
jade_mtp_http_https_keyStoreFile=mykeys.ks<br>
jade_mtp_http_https_keyStorePass=mypassword<br>
jade_mtp_http_https_trustManagerClass=jade.mtp.http.https.FriendListAuthentication<br>
jade_mtp_http_https_friendListFile=friends.ks<br>
jade_mtp_http_https_friendListPass=mypassword<br>
--------------------------<br><br>

To run this configurations we only need to invoke JADE with this
configuration file:<br><br>
<b>java jade.Boot -conf jade.conf</b><br>
