		<h1>Tutorial 1: JADE Architecture Overview</h1>
		<p>This tutorial provides an overview of the JADE Architecture introducing the notions of 
		<ul>
	 		<li><b>Agent</b></li>
			<li><b>Container</b></li>
			<li><b>Platform</b></li>
			<li><b>Main Container</b></li>
			<li><b>AMS</b> and <b>DF</b></li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		
		Figure 1 represents the main JADE architectural elements. An application based on JADE is made of 
		a set of components called <i><b>Agents</b></i> each one having a unique name. Agents execute tasks and interact by 
		exchanging messages. Look at the <a href="">JADE Programming Tutorial</a> for a detailed explanation 
		about how to develop agents and to make them execute tasks and communicate. Agents live on top of a <i><b>Platform</b></i>
		that provides them with basic services such as message delivery. A platform is composed of one or more <i><b>Containers</b></i>.
		Containers can be executed on different hosts thus achieving a <b>distributed</b> platform. Each container can 
		contain zero or more agents. For instance, with reference to the picture below, container "Container 1" in host <i>Host 3</i> 
		contains agents A2 and A3. Even if in some particular scenarios this is not always the case, you can think of a Container 
		as a JVM (so, 1 JVM ==> 1 container ==> 0 or many agents). A special container called <i><b>Main Container</b></i> exists in 
		the platform. The main container is itself a container and can therefore contain agents, but differs from other 
		containers as
		<ol>
			<li>It must be the first container to start in the platform and all other containers register to it 
			at bootstrap time</li>
			<li>It includes two special agents: the <i><b>AMS</b></i> that represents the authority in the platform and is the only
			agent able to perform platform management actions such as starting and killing agents or shutting down the whole
			platform (normal agents can request such actions to the AMS). The <i><b>DF</b></i> that provides the <b>Yellow Pages</b>
			service where agents can publish the services they provide and find other agents providing the services they need.</li>
		</ol>

		<b>Figure 1. The JADE Architecture</b>
		
		<p>It should be noticed that if another main container is started, as in host <i>Host 4</i> in Figure 1, this constitutes a
		new platform. Agents can communicate transparently regardless of whether they live in the same container (e.g. A2 and A3), 
		in different containers (in the same or in different hosts) belonging to the same platform (e.g. A1 and A2) or in different
		platforms (e.g. A1 and A5).
