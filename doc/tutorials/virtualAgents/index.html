		<p><i><a href="http://jade.tilab.com">JADE </a>version</i>: 4.3 or later.</p>
		
		<p>This tutorial is designed to help readers understanding what <b>Virtual Replicated Agents</b> are, where/when they can be 
		useful and how to implement them. The reader is assumed to be already familiar with JADE main architectural concepts 
		(platform, containers, main-container, agents ...) and JADE programming. If this is not the case we strongly suggest reading the
		<a href="../JADEAdmin/index.html">JADE Administration Tutorial</a> and the <a href="../JADEProgramming-Tutorial-for-beginners.pdf">JADE Programming Tutorial</a> first.
		</p>
		<p>In order to exemplify how to use Virtual Replicated Agents this tutorial makes use of a simple example whose source code is included 
		in the JADE examples distribution in package <code>examples.replication</code>.
		
		<h2>1. Virtual Replicated Agents Overview</h2>
		A "<b>Virtual Replicated Agent</b>" (shortly VR agent) is a virtual entity: it is just a name (more precisely an AID) that does not identify a 
		concrete agent. On the other hand "behind" that name there are one or more concrete agents called the virtual agent <b>Replicas</b>. 
		As depicted in Figure 1, JADE takes care of dispatching messages directed to the VR agent to a suitable replica. 
		It should be noticed that each replica agent has its own name that differs from that of the VR agent. 
		A VR agent does not have a location while of course each replica agent runs on a well-defined container/host.

		A simple yet flexible mechanism is provided to keep the internal state of each replica of a VR agent in synch. Therefore VR agents are a 
		powerful mean to achieve <b>scalability</b> and <b>fault tolerance</b>. For instance, with reference to Figure 1, all requests sent to 
		VR agent A are automatically dispatched partly to replica A-R1 and partly to replica A-R2. Now let's assume that Container-1
		where replica A-R1 is running suddenly crashes. Other agents interacting with VR agent A do not even realize that, since all messages will be 
		automatically dispatched by JADE to replica A-R2 only.<br>
		<br>
		The first replica of a VR agent is called the <b>master</b> replica. Other replicas can be created at whatever point in time and their internal state 
		is copied from that of the master replica. Furthermore the master replica is notified about addition and removal of other replicas.<br>
		<br>
		VR agents require the <b>Agent Replication Service</b> (class <code>jade.core.replication.AgentReplicationService</code>) and the 
		Agent Mobility Service in all containers of the platform. The first one actually provides replication features, while the second one is used to 
		clone the master replica when a new replica must be created. 
		
		
		<h2>2. The Value Provider Agent example</h2>
		In this section we describe the Value Provider Agent example that is used to illustrate how to use Virtual Replicated Agents 
		and we show how to launch and try it. The code of the Value Provider Agent example, that is included in the 
		<code>examples.replication</code> package of the Jade examples distribution, will be presented in next section.
		<br>
		The example is composed of two agents:
		<ol>
			<li>The <b>ValueProviderAgent</b> - This agent has a minimal internal state composed of a numeric value. A simple GUI, shown in 
				Figure 2, with a slider allows setting the numeric value. It is possible to request the ValueProviderAgent to provide its 
				internal numeric value by means of the <code>GetValue</code> action of the <code>ValueManagementOntology</code>. 
				This is the agent that actually shows the usage of Virtual Replicated agents: it defines itself as the master replica of a 
				Virtual Replicated agent and includes a button to create new replicas. Only the master replica keeps its GUI visible.</li>
			<li>The <b>ValueReaderAgent</b> - This agent periodically requests the Virtual Replicated Value Provider Agent to 
				provide its internal numeric value and prints it on the standard output. Its purpose is just to show that, regardless of which 
				replica a request is dispatched to, the returned value is actually that shown in the master replica GUI. 
				Furthermore replicas (including the master) can be killed and 
				created at will without affecting the responses received by the ValueReaderAgent at all.</li>
		</ol>

		<b>Figure 2. The Value Provider Agent GUI</b>
		</center></p>
		
		In order to try the Value Provider Agent example follow the steps below:
		<ol>
			<li>Download Jade in binary form (<b>jadeBin</b>) plus the jade examples (<b>jadeExamples</b>) and unzip them in the same directory thus 
			obtaining the following directory structure<br>
			<pre>
...
 |--jade/
      |--...
      |--lib/
          |--jade.jar
          |--jadeExamples.jar
          |--...
      |
      |--src/
          |--...
          |--examples/
                |--...
                |--replication/
                |-- sources of the Value Provider Agent example		
			</pre>	  
			</li>
			
			<li>Open a shell (a DOS prompt in windows), move to the <code>jade</code> directory and launch the Main Container with the 
			ValueProviderAgent and ValueReaderAgent on top by typing<br>
			<br>
			<code>java -cp lib/jade.jar;lib/jadeExamples.jar jade.Boot -gui -services jade.core.event.NotificationService;jade.core.mobility.AgentMobilityService;jade.core.replication.AgentReplicationService -agents provider:examples.replication.ValueProviderAgent;reader:examples.replication.ValueReaderAgent</code><br>
			<br>
			<i>NOTE: In a UNIX-like environment the ':' character must be used (instead of ';') as a separator between classpath elements. 
			Furthermore the ';' used to separate services and agents must be escaped (\;)</i><br>
			<br>
			Refer to the <a href="../..administratorsguide.pdf">JADE Administrator's Guide</a> for details about JADE command line syntax and options.<br>
			<br>
			</li>
			
			<li>Move the slider in the ValueProviderAgent GUI and verifies that the ValueReaderAgent prints the expected value on the standard output
			</li>
			
			<li>Open a new shell move to the <code>jade</code> directory and launch a peripheral container by typing<br>
			<br>
			<code>java -cp lib/jade.jar;lib/jadeExamples.jar jade.Boot -container -services jade.core.event.NotificationService;jade.core.mobility.AgentMobilityService;jade.core.replication.AgentReplicationService</code><br>
			<br>
			</li>

			<li>Now, by means of the "Create Replica" button of the ValueProviderAgent GUI, create a new replica in the newly created peripheral container.<br>
			Modify again the internal numeric value by moving the slider: looking at the messages printed on the standard output, you may notice that
				<ul>
				<li>The internal numeric value of the newly created replica is updated too.</li>
				<li>Requests to get the numeric value sent by the ValueReaderAgent are automatically distributed on both replicas</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			
			<li>Finally kill the master replica by means of the Jade Administration GUI. The GUI disappears and immediately re-appears. This is
			because the replica running on Container-1 becomes the new master replica and reacts to this event by making its GUI visible.<br> 
			Furthermore requests sent by the ValueReaderAgent are fully directed to the replica on Container-1 so that the ValueReaderAgent does not
			even realize that the old master replica suddenly disappeared.
			</li>
		</ol>
				  
			
		<h2>3. Virtual Replicated Agent code</h2>
		In this section we look into the ValueProviderAgent code to see how the behaviour described in Chapter 2 is achieved.<br>
		The code snippet below shows the <code>setup()</code> and <code>takeDown()</code> methods.<br> 
		<pre>
 1	public class ValueProviderAgent extends Agent implements AgentReplicationHelper.Listener {
 2 	
 3 		private transient ValueProviderAgentGui myGui;
 4		private int myValue = 0;
 5 	
 6		@Override
 7		protected void setup() {
 8			try {
 9				// Makes this agent become the master replica of a newly defined replicated agent
10				AgentReplicationHelper helper = (AgentReplicationHelper) getHelper(AgentReplicationHelper.SERVICE_NAME);
11				AID virtualAid = helper.makeVirtual(getLocalName()+"_V", AgentReplicationHelper.HOT_REPLICATION);
12
13				// Register to the DF. 
14				// NOTE: we use the virtual agent AID (not the concrete agent AID).
15				// In this way requests from remote agents will be automatically spread across 
16				// all replicas to achieve load balancing and fault tolerance.
17				DFAgentDescription dfad = new DFAgentDescription();
18				dfad.setName(virtualAid);
19				ServiceDescription sd = new ServiceDescription();
20				sd.setType("ValueProvider");
21				sd.setName("VirtualValueProvider");
22				dfad.addServices(sd);
23				DFService.register(this, dfad);
24			
25				// Register required ontologies and language codecs
26				getContentManager().registerLanguage(new SLCodec());
27				getContentManager().registerOntology(ValueManagementOntology.getInstance());
28
29				// Add the behaviour serving requests to read our current value
30				addBehaviour(new OntologyServer(this, ValueManagementOntology.getInstance(), ACLMessage.REQUEST, this));
31			
32				// Show the GUI that allows the user to set the value and to create other replicas
33				myGui = new ValueProviderAgentGui(this, myValue);
34				myGui.setVisible(true);
35			}
36			catch (ServiceException se) {
37				System.out.println("Agent "+getLocalName()+" - Error retrieving AgentReplicationHelper!!! Check that the AgentReplicationService is correctly installed in this container");
38				se.printStackTrace();
39				doDelete();
40			}
41			catch (FIPAException fe) {
42				System.out.println("Agent "+getLocalName()+" - Error registering with the DF");
43				fe.printStackTrace();
44				doDelete();
45			}
46		}
47	
48		@Override
49		protected void takeDown() {
50			// Close the GUI (if present) when the agent terminates
51			if (myGui != null) {
52				myGui.dispose();
53			}
54		}
		</pre>
		Let's focus first on lines 10 and 11. The first instruction retrieves the ServiceHelper of the AgentReplicationService. The second one allows 
		declaring that this agent is the master replica of a Virtual Replicated Agent. The <code>HOT_REPLICATION</code> parameter
		specifies that messages directed to the VR agent will be dispatched indifferently to all available replicas. If <code>COLD_REPLICATION</code>
		was used, all messages would have been dispatched to the master replica only (other replicas used for fault tolerance purpose only).<br>
		<br>
		
		<pre>
55	
56		@Override
57		public void afterClone() {
58			// New replicas are created cloning the master replica.
59			// Just after cloning restore transient field such as registered ontologies and language codecs
60			getContentManager().registerLanguage(new SLCodec());
61			getContentManager().registerOntology(ValueManagementOntology.getInstance());
62		}
		</pre>
